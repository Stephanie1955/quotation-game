# QuoteVersion2025_11_16

Small static quote/demo site. This repository contains a minimal front-end with the following files:

- `index.html` — the page markup
- `script.js` — JavaScript used by the page
- `style.css` — page styles

How to view

- Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or
- Serve the folder locally (recommended) and open `http://localhost:8000`

Example (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\steph\Code\src\QuoteVersion2025_11_16"
python -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Notes

- This is a static site; there are no server-side dependencies. The included `.gitignore` excludes common editor, OS, and build artifacts.

If you'd like, I can add a license, CI, or a short development plan next.
